# Alterac Valley Additions
The goal of this module is to improve the spawns and pathing of creatures found in Alterac Valley.

It phases many creatures that are already there to hide them and adds a lot more to replace them on top of adding a lot of missing spawns. It adds pathing to the creatures that should have it too.
